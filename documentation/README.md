Each folder will have a **README.md** file inside of them - as well as any other folders to link to any.

This is done for convenience, when viewing in GitHub. Feel free to click the folders to open its corresponding **README.md** file.

It may be more convenient (especially if viewing locally) to just view the contents in the (project root)[../README.md].
