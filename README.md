# Bandcamp Boxes

## Description

This repo is a base repo to contain documentation, key information and potentially submodules/workspaces (to be determined) for Bandcamp-boxes.

To read this documentation, see the Contents (below), or traverse into the documentation folders. Each folder will have a corresponding **README.md** file for easy viewing in GitHub.

## Contents

1. [Project Creation](./project-creation/README.md)
    - [BB Box Editor](./project-creation/bb-box-editor/README.md)
2. [Creating a Draggable Box](./creating-a-draggable-box/README.md)

## Overview

This project is designed to allow users to create a grid-like structure to include their bandcamp releases all in one page.

Users will be able to have a visual space in which they can edit their layout to a horizontal grid of their choosing. E.g. 3x boxes per row.

This would mainly be squares, as the bandcamp boxes are made with such shapes in mind. However, if a user would like to be more decorative with their page and fill in some gaps, tall or wide rectangles can be used for photos or gifs.

They should also be able to upload new releases and have them.
